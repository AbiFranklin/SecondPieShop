        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <b>Bethany's Pie Shop</b>, where pie-baking perfection meets
          convenience! For countless years, Bethany's passion for crafting the most
          scrumptious pies has been an unmatched delight. Our journey began in 2013
          when we unveiled our first charming store in the heart of Brussels,
          nestled in a cozy little street near the illustrious Grand Market. It was
          from here that our pies first captured the hearts and taste buds of people
          from every corner of the globe, from delectable soft cakes to hevenly
          cheesecakes and tantalizingly spiced apple pies.</p>
        <p>As the demand for
          Bethany's divine creations soared, an incredible milestone was reached in
          2015, when we proudly sold an astonishing 100 pies each day! Naturally,
          our beloved Pie Shop had to evolve, and we relocated to a grander, more
          apcious building to better serve our cherished patrons.</p>
        <i>The love and support we received from our ever-growing community
          inspired us to explore new possibilities.</i>
